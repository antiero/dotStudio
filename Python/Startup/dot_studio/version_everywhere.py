# version_up_everywhere.py 
# Adds action to enable a Clip/Shot to be Min/Max/Next/Prev versioned in all shots used in a Project.
#
# Usage: 
# 1) Copy file to <HIERO_PLUGIN_PATH>/Python/Startup
# 2) Right-click on Clip(s) or Bins containing Clips in in the Bin View, or on Shots in the Timeline/Spreadsheet
# 3) Set Version for all Shots > OPTION to update the version in all shots where the Clip is used in the Project.
