# dotStudio - Nuke Studio Python Code

This is a collection of Python code, including UI elements, menu helper actions and exporters which I compiled over my years at The Foundry.

Much of this code is untested in the latest versions of Nuke Studio (I think I had it working back at around version 8/9!)

## How to Use

Copy the `Python/Startup/dot_studio` directory to your `~/.nuke` directory

(or custom Plugin Path, see [here](https://learn.foundry.com/hiero/developers/2.0/hieropythondevguide/setup.html) for details on configuring Plugin Paths in Hiero/NukeStudio)

## Please Note

I'm no longer actively using Hiero or Nuke Studio not maintaining/supporting these, but if you have any enquiries please feel free to get in touch.

Please feel free to make fixes and submit pull requests!
